Beetle
======

Beetle is a simple static blog, mostly driven by NIH thinking and a naive wish for extendability.

So far, it works for me (TM), and I think I can guarentee that you will find it clunky and hard to work with.

I should give credit where credit is due, so:

* Armin Ronacher for his RSTBlog that really got me interested in making a static blog engine.
* Mike Cooper for wok, and showing me there is a simple way to make a static blog - I could easily have ended up using wok or a patched version thereof.
* Jeff Knupp for pointing out that it's ok to make your own static blog engine, since it's so simple.

Todo:
----

* Page defaults by category.
* Content rendering by file extentions.
* Multipages.
* Beter subpage handling and pagination thereof.
